This is a C++/OpenGL program that draws a random 2D Maze given user inputs.
The program uses a Disjoint Set data structure at the core to construct the maze.

There's also an implementation of the A* algorithm to traverse this maze in the 
shortest path available. Given that the maze is always drawn to have a path to an
exit, there will always be a path found. The path is drawn as red circles in each cell
of the maze from the entrance to the exit.
